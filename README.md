For the purpose of running the functions I JavaScript, I primarily used JQuery and found it to be a much easier and user friendly means of programming. I certainly cuts down on the length of code, making it easier to decipher and troubleshoot when a problem did occur. What is needed to install this application? Another thing I enjoyed about this assignment, other than the styling and personalization of each quiz question, was inserting a few prompts and alerts to make this quiz seem even more interactive. Also, giving and initial clue to the trickery of some of these questions. No one at first seemed to read this questions too carefully, although they had been alerted to do so. In order to use this app, run the app in the: All in all, I did really enjoy this project. I admit, I prefer coding from scratch opposed to receiving starter code. It gives me a sense of more control and it's easier to chase down problems when I am more familiar with the base code from top to bottom.
